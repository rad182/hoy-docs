				<p>A. HOY FAQs
				<br />
				<br />
				(A.1) What is Hoy?
				<br />
				<br />
				Hoy gives you the power to let the world see what brands you love. Influence your friends to try the newest product or hippest place in town and get rewarded for it.
				<br />
				<br />
				Hoy is a new form of social media advertising that is both fun and engaging. The app lets netizens share with their network the emotional connection they have with the brands they are passionate about.
				<br />
				<br />
				Hoy offers Real Rewards to Everyone. Download the app now and start sharing your photos.
				<br />
				<br />
				(A.2) Why is Hoy only available in selected cities?
				<br />
				<br />
				We give our partner brands the freedom to choose the coverage of their campaigns.  Some of our brands may prefer to advertise in specific regions or to a particular target market. 
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				B. GENERAL APP FAQs
				<br />
				<br />
				(B.1) What is a Campaign?
				<br />
				<br />
				Campaign is an adrewards marketing program that gives you an opportunity to earn rewards when you share photos with the brands you love.  Hoy features a number of campaigns with rewards from different brands so you can choose which campaign to join based on the brand you love, and the reward you want to earn.
				<br />
				<br />
				The Quick Rewards Campaign allows users to show their support for their favorite brands and get rewarded for it.  In this campaign, you post a video entry that contains a branded animated filter, and once validated to have followed the general rules and the campaign guidelines, you will receive a digistub that contains information on how to redeem your reward.  In the Quick Rewards Campaign, your entries do not need a single like in order to qualify for the reward.
				<br />
				<br />
				The total number of users to be rewarded in this type of campaign is equivalent to the number of rewards set by the brand.  For example, a campaign may have 50 rewards to give away. The winners of the rewards will be the first 50 users whose posts achieve the Goal and have been validated to have followed the general rules and guidelines.
				<br />
				<br />
				In the High-Value Rewards Campaign, users may submit a photo entry for a period of time (i.e., duration).  When the duration ends, the submitted entries with the highest number of likes will receive the reward.  The brand will also select a number of entries that will be receiving the rewards. Half of the rewards will be given to the posts with the most number likes, and the other half will be given to users whose posts were selected by the brand.
				<br />
				<br />
				The entries must include a caption or a story that relates to the content of the entry and the brand being promoted.
				<br />
				<br />
				(B.2) What is a Post?
				<br />
				<br />
				A post is the selfie or any other photo you capture and submit via the Hoy app when participating in a campaign. Your post is required to follow the campaign goal, which may be the type of content required in your post, and the general rules. Your post is your ticket to earning your reward so make sure you read and follow the campaign information and the general rules carefully.
				<br />
				<br />
				(B.3) What is a Goal?
				<br />
				<br />
				A goal is a requirement set by the brand regarding what memory to capture in order for the user to receive the corresponding reward.  For example, the brand may specify that the user take a selfie with the brand’s logo, or with a specific retail sign. If your photo does not conform to the goal, your photo may be invalidated which disqualifies you from getting the reward.
				<br />
				<br />
				(B.4) What is a Reward?
				<br />
				<br />
				A Reward is a product or service awarded to a user from the brand when the user’s post accomplishes the goal requirements. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Rewarded users get a Digital Stub to be presented to the participating store or redemption area upon claim.
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				C. HOY CAMPAIGNS FAQ
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.1) What is a Hoy Campaign?
				<br />
				<br />
				Hoy Campaigns are rewards-based programs that are hosted on the Hoy app. When you participate in a Hoy campaign, your selfie gets posted only on the Hoy app and the likes that are counted towards your Goal will be the likes your Hoy selfie earns.
				<br />
				<br />
				For Hoy campaigns, the number of likes that are qualified and will be counted towards the Goal will be the number of likes your memory or selfie earns in the Hoy app.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.2) What is a "Fan" and a "Hoya"?
				<br />
				<br />
				Your "Fans" are those who follow you on Hoy. The "Hoya" are the people you follow.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.3) Can I apply photo or video filters to my Hoy Posts?
				<br />
				<br />
				Both yes and no. Yes, you can apply photo or video filters to your Hoy posts BUT only minimal enhancements and alterations are allowed. The product's color or brand logo should not be altered. Other alterations that are NOT allowed include: monochrome (black &amp; white) or saturation settings, tiled, grid or inset (photo in photo) layouts, icons/stickers, texts, frames, and borders.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.4) How do I delete my account in Hoy?
				<br />
				<br />
				Please send us a request email with a 'Delete Account' subject line to <a href="mailto:admin@hoyrewards.com">admin@hoyrewards.com</a>.
				<br />
				<br />
				The following are applicable to Hoy Campaigns only.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.5) Why do I need to Verify My Identity?
				<br />
				<br />
				Hoy gives Real Rewards to Real People. That's why we take measures in verifying your identity to know that we are giving rewards to real persons and not bots or trolls. Hoy protects the brands and the rewards because we care. As a user, you are also ensured of that you are playing with legitimate people through this social media platform.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.6) How come some of my Fans are not seeing my Hoy posts? 
				<br />
				<br />
				The percentage of your fanbase that are allowed to view your Hoy post is relative to the number of likes you need to pursue to achieve a Goal. This is our way of creating a fair playing field for all users regardless of the number of followers they may have. It doesn't matter if you have 200 or 2,000 followers, since fanbases are scaled depending on the likes needed to achieve the Goal. Even if some of your Fans may not be able to view and vote for your Hoy posts, all of them can still view your Hoy posts when they visit your profile page.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.7) How many photos can I submit for every reward?
				<br />
				<br />
				You can submit two (2) photos for every reward that you want to pursue. Want more chances of winning? Don't worry, there are still more Hoy rewards to pursue. Check out the rewards list.
				<br />
				<br />
				(C.8) Why can't I like another user's Hoy post if I already liked his/her post for the same reward?
				<br />
				<br />
				Everyone likes to pursue a reward fair and square. In order to eliminate bribery of likes (likes-for-likes or spam-for-spam), you can no longer like another user's Hoy post if he/she has already liked your post under the same reward. This ONLY  applies to rewards that require a low number of likes.
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				D. FACEBOOK-HOY CAMPAIGNS FAQ
				<br />
				<br />
				(D.1) What are Facebook-Hoy! Campaigns
				<br />
				<br />
				Facebook-Hoy! Campaigns are marked with a Facebook logo on the Campaign icon. When you participate in a Facebook-Hoy! Campaign, your selfie gets posted both on the Hoy app and on your Facebook account. 
				<br />
				<br />
				The likes that will be counted towards your Goal will be the sum of your Facebook likes and Hoy likes.
				<br />
				<br />
				(D.2) Why are my Facebook likes not equal to the number of likes posted in the app?
				<br />
				<br />
				For Facebook-Hoy! Campaigns, the number of likes that are qualified and are counted towards the Goal will be number of likes your memory earns in the Hoy app PLUS the number of positive Facebook likes.
				<br />
				<br />
				Positive Facebook likes include likes and positive reactions ( happy, excited, etc.,). If your post gets an ANGRY reaction, that will not be considered a positive FB like and will NOT be counted towards your Goal. 
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				E. ADVERTISER FAQ
				<br />
				<br />
				(E.1) What kind of rewards can I give?
				<br />
				<br />
				You can give any reward as long as it is related to your brand, product, or service. Rewards are tiered according to their price and quantity.
				<br />
				<br />
				(E.2) How much do I have to pay for a Hoy campaign?
				<br />

				<br />
				<br />Hoy gives you the power to let the world see what brands you love. Influence your friends to try the newest product or hippest place in town, and get rewarded.

				<br />
				<br />Currently, the existing targeted advertising on the leading social media networks relies heavily on the information that we feed. But being "social" is supposed to be about being connected with friends, family and with real people. We are about to
				redefine how we relate with others through our photos and videos. HoyTechnology Asia Inc. through Hoy maximizes the moments you share with those you know. Hoy offers a unique platform of advertising				that is more personal, social, and rewarding both for users and advertisers.

			<br />
			<br />
			A.1) Hoy (otherwise, the "Service") is a social media platform for advertising wherein you upload your self portrait (otherwise,"Selfie") photos to capture moments and memories with the brands that you relate with.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.2) A "Selfie" is a self-portrait photograph taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone. In Hoy, photos of you taken by other people may also be considered a Selfie. A selfie may also be referred to herein as a memory.

			<br />
			<br />
			A.7) A "Reward" is the preset award or gift the User receives if you reach the required minimum number of likes for a campaign. The Reward is subject to conditions as seen in our Reward Redemption Policies.

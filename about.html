			<p>Let's get more social!
				<br />
				<br />Hoy gives you the power to let the world see what brands you love. Influence your friends to try the newest product or hippest place in town, and get rewarded.
				<br />
				<br />Hoy is the new form of social media advertising that is both fun and engaging. This app lets netizens share an emotional connection with the brands that matter most.
				<br />
				<br />Currently, the existing targeted advertising on the leading social media networks relies heavily on the information that we feed. But being "social" is supposed to be about being connected with friends, family and with real people. We are about to
				redefine how we relate with others through our photos and videos. HoyTechnology Asia Inc. through Hoy maximizes the moments you share with those you know. Hoy offers a unique platform of advertising				that is more personal, social, and rewarding both for users and advertisers.

			<p>REWARDS REDEMPTION
				<br />
				<br />1) Approval for photos pending for Rewards shall undergo the approval of the Hoy Verification Team. Merchants may send their suggestions and comments in cases when they deem the photos awaiting for
				rewards approval is not in line with the Goal, their product, or their brand, or if it affects the Merchant in any negative way. 
				<br />
				<br />2) The Reward pursued is obtained by first-come-first serve based on the specific number of Rewards (per person) specified by the Merchant in exchange for a specific number
				of likes per post.
				<br />
				<br />3) Rewarded Users will get a Digital Stub containing the following: (a) unique code, (b) reward description, and (c) redemption instruction.
				<br />
				<br />4) Users whose Hoy personal information and identification requirements do not match are forfeited for claiming the reward.
				<br />
				<br />5) In cases when the Reward is not available upon redemption, the Brand has the option to exchange the Reward for another product or service of the same value. This applies to Rewards that are distributed at the Brand’s retail store. However, if the redemption location is a third-party store (i.e., not the Brand’s retail store such as, for example, a convenience store), the Reward may not be exchange for another product or service of the same value. The User may visit another brand of the third-party store to redeem the Reward. Alternatively, the Brand and the User may agree to move the Rewards redemption at another place and/or time until the Reward is available. The Brand and/or the third-party store are responsible in dispensing their Rewards. HTAC is not responsible and will not be held liable for issues regarding the Rewards other than Brands adhering to the handing out of their Rewards to qualified users.

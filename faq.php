			<p>			A. HOY FAQs
			<br />
			<br />
			(A.1) What is Hoy?
			<br />
			<br />
			Hoy gives you the power to let the world see what brands you love. Influence your friends to try the newest product or hippest place in town and get rewarded for it.
			<br />
			<br />
			Hoy is a new form of social media advertising that is both fun and engaging. The app lets netizens share with their network the emotional connection they have with the brands they are passionate about.
			<br />
			<br />
			Hoy offers Real Rewards to Everyone. Download the app now and start sharing your photos.
			<br />
			<br />
			(A.2) Why is Hoy only available in selected cities?
			<br />
			<br />
			We give our partner brands the freedom to choose the coverage of their campaigns.  Some of our brands may prefer to advertise in specific regions or to a particular target market.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			B. GENERAL APP FAQs
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.1) What is a Campaign?
			<br />
			<br />
			Campaign is an adrewards marketing program that gives you an opportunity to earn rewards when you share photos with the brands you love.  Hoy features a number of campaigns with rewards from different brands so you can choose which campaign to join based on the brand you love, and the reward you want to earn.
			<br />
			<br />
			The Quick Rewards Campaign allows users to show their support for their favorite brands and get rewarded for it.  In this campaign, you post a video entry that contains a branded animated filter, and once validated to have followed the general rules and the campaign guidelines, you will receive a digistub that contains information on how to redeem your reward.  In the Quick Rewards Campaign, your entries do not need a single like in order to qualify for the reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			The total number of users to be rewarded in this type of campaign is equivalent to the number of rewards set by the brand.  For example, a campaign may have 50 rewards to give away. The winners of the rewards will be the first 50 users whose posts achieve the Goal and have been validated to have followed the general rules and guidelines.
			<br />
			<br />
			In the High-Value Rewards Campaign, users may submit a photo entry for a period of time (i.e., duration).  When the duration ends, the submitted entries with the highest number of likes will receive the reward.  The brand will also select a number of entries that will be receiving the rewards. Half of the rewards will be given to the posts with the most number likes, and the other half will be given to users whose posts were selected by the brand.
			<br />
			<br />
			The entries must include a caption or a story that relates to the content of the entry and the brand being promoted.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.2) What is a Post?
			<br />
			<br />
			A post is the selfie or any other photo you capture and submit via the Hoy app when participating in a campaign. Your post is required to follow the campaign goal, which may be the type of content required in your post, and the general rules. Your post is your ticket to earning your reward so make sure you read and follow the campaign information and the general rules carefully.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.3) What is a Goal?
			<br />
			<br />
			A goal is a requirement set by the brand regarding what memory to capture in order for the user to receive the corresponding reward.  For example, the brand may specify that the user take a selfie with the brand’s logo, or with a specific retail sign. If your photo does not conform to the goal, your photo may be invalidated which disqualifies you from getting the reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.4) What is a Reward?
			<br />
			<br />
			A Reward is a product or service awarded to a user from the brand when the user’s post accomplishes the goal requirements.
			<br />
			<br />
			In High-Value Rewards Campaigns, there are two sets of users that will be receiving the reward - users whose posts have achieved the highest number of likes after the campaign duration has ended, and users whose posts were selected by the brand sponsoring the campaign. We allow the brand to select winners regardless of the number of likes their posts receive to encourage users who may not have a huge following and still give them a chance to be rewarded for supporting their favorite brands.
			<br />
			<br />
			For Quick Rewards Campaigns, the rewards may be awarded in a first-come-first-served basis. For example, if a campaign have 50 rewards to give away, you will receive the reward if you’re one of the first 50 users who submitted their posts.  Terms and conditions will apply.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.5) How do I redeem my Reward?
			<br />
			<br />
			When your post has been verified to have followed the terms and conditions for receiving the reward, you will receive a Digistub. The Digistub will include instructions on how to redeem your reward, such as redemption locations, a code that verifies your reward, and a photo of the reward you’ll be receiving.
			<br />
			<br />
			Simply present a valid ID that matches the first and last name in both your Hoy profile and the Digistub to the participating store to claim your reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			For Quick Rewards, if a redemption location such as a convenience store or supermarket runs out of rewards to distribute, we advise you to visit another branch of the store or supermarket. Please consult the customer service section for supermarket redemption locations, or the store manager of the convenience store for any issues with regards to the rewards redemption.
			<br />
			<br />
			The brand sponsoring the campaign and the redemption locations are responsible for distributing the rewards.  Hoy does not have any control over the rewards, their storage, and their distribution. Hoy allows the brand and the redemption locations full control over the rewards redemption as long as they follow certain guidelines.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.6) Can I apply photo or video filters to my Posts?
			<br />
			<br />
			Yes and no. Yes, you can apply photo or video filters to your Posts BUT only minimal enhancements and alterations are allowed. The product’s color or brand logo should not be altered. Other alterations that are NOT allowed include: monochrome (black & white) or saturation settings, tiled, grid or inset (photo in photo) layouts, icons/stickers, texts, frames, and borders.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.7) How do I delete my account in Hoy?
			<br />
			<br />
			Please send us a request email with a 'Delete Account' subject line to admin@hoyrewards.com.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.8) Why do I need to Verify My Profile?
			<br />
			<br />
			Some campaigns require Hoy Likes which can only be given by verified users.  We take extra measures in verifying your identity to know that we are giving rewards to real people and not to bots, trolls, or users who creates multiple accounts. Hoy protects the brands and the rewards because we care. As a user, you are also ensured that you are interacting with legitimate people when you use our social media platform.
			<br />
			<br />
			(B.9) Why did my submission fail the verification?
			<br />
			<br />
			There are many possible reasons why your submission may have failed verification. While the video is being recorded, we will check if your post includes your face during the entire duration of the video.  If there is any time in your video where your face is away from the camera, this may cause verification to fail.  Other factors that will be used in the verification that may cause you to fail verification include: multiple faces detected in the video, and using phony non-human faces (e.g., photos of faces, stickers, masks).
			<br />
			<br />
			During the video recording, we require users to read two words to ensure that the user is taking a live video.  If you fail to read the words correctly, this may also cause verification to fail. We also do not allow multiple submissions from the same user and if we detect that you have already previously submitted an entry, your second submission may also fail verification.
			<br />
			<br />
			B.10) How many entries can I submit for every Reward?
			<br />
			<br />
			You can submit only one (1) entry for every campaign. Want more chances of winning? Don’t worry, there’s a lot of Hoy rewards to pursue and other campaigns to join. Don’t forget to check out the Rewards list.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			C. LIKES FAQs
			<br />
			<br />
			(C.1) Do I Need Specific Types of Likes for the Campaigns?
			<br />
			<br />
			No, the campaigns will not specify a type of like.  However, likes given by a single user on Hoy and Facebook  will be automatically counted as a single like. For example, if user Jane Smith has liked an entry posted in HOY and Facebook, the two likes by the same user Jane Smith will only be counted as one.
			<br />
			<br />
			(C.2) Why are my Facebook likes not equal to the number of likes posted in the app?
			<br />
			<br />
			Only positive Facebook likes are qualified and counted towards your likes.  Positive Facebook likes will only include likes and positive reactions ( happy, excited, etc.,). If your entry gets an Angry reaction, that will not be considered a positive Facebook Like and will NOT be counted towards your Goal.
			<br />
			<br />
			(C.3) My post has received one of the highest number of likes after the campaign period, but why is my post still “Pending”?
			<br />
			<br />
			This applies to posts submitted in High Value Rewards Campaigns which considers the number of likes your post has received on the duration of the campaign. If your post is marked “Pending,” your post qualifies for the reward and is pending verification for adherence to the general rules and other guidelines.  The brand may still be selecting the other posts to be rewarded. Please note that it may take one to three days for the brand to select the other posts to be rewarded.
			<br />
			<br />
			Once we have all the winners, we will validate them for adherence to the general guidelines and you will be receiving the Digistub upon successful validation.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			D. POST STATUSES FAQs
			<br />
			<br />
			In High-Value Rewards Campaigns, your posts can have one of these statuses: Rewarded, Pending, and Invalid.  Your post’s status will give you an idea about how close you are to getting your reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			(D.1) Pending
			<br />
			<br />
			A post tagged as “Pending” means that you have successfully achieved the required goal and your post has received the highest number of likes after the duration of the campaign. Your post will now be reviewed by our team and the brand for adherence to the guidelines. The brand or the Hoy team reserves the right to make the final decision with regards to the eligibility of your post.
			<br />
			<br />
			After successful validation, you will be eligible for the reward and your post will be marked as “Rewarded.”
			<br />
			<br />
			(D.2) Rewarded
			<br />
			<br />
			A post tagged as “Rewarded” means that you have achieved the goal, and your post has been verified to have followed the general rules. Congrats! Once your post is marked as “Rewarded”, you will receive a Digital Stub (Digistub) containing details on how to claim your reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			(D.3) Invalid
			<br />
			<br />
			A post tagged as “Invalid” means that your post did not pass our goal verification test. Your post may not have followed the goal set in the campaign and/or the General Rules. To avoid invalidity of your post, make sure you read and follow the guidelines of the campaign before participating.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			E. REDEMPTION OF REWARDS FAQs
			<br />
			<br />
			(E.1) Do you ship Rewards?
			<br />
			<br />
			Hoy does not support shipping of rewards to users.  However, there are some campaigns that will shoulder the shipping and shipping costs of rewards. This information will be indicated in the campaign information and the Digistub.
			<br />
			<br />
			If it is not indicated, then shipping is not supported.  You are encouraged to participate in campaigns located in the city you are currently in (e.g., Manila and Cebu, for now) to avoid complications in the redemption of rewards.
			<br />
			<br />
			(E.2) Can I allow someone to claim my rewards in my behalf or to transfer the reward to somebody else?
			<br />
			<br />
			Unfortunately, rewards are not transferable and we do not allow someone else to claim your rewards in your behalf, even with a written permission on your end. Our partner brands will verify your Digistub with your identification documents to see if it matches the person who is claiming the reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			F. ADVERTISER FAQs

			<br />

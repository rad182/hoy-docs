			I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
			<br />
			<br />
			You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you access Hoy or a Hoy third party application. Hoy and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are required to provide us with complete and accurate information upon our request. If you choose not to do so, there may be instances where we are not able to provide you with our products or services e.g., Rewards, or respond to any queries you may have.
			<br />
			<br />
			We Collect the Following Types of Information:
			<br />
			<br />
			(a.) Upon sign-up, Hoy requires a user name that will be associated with your account and your complete personal information which must match with a first and last name as it appears on any valid ID. Your personal information which is consistent with the name on the valid ID presented will be used as basis to qualify for a reward claim.
			<br />
			<br />
			(b.) Information that you may use in your profile including password, location, phone number, email address, contact preferences when you register for a Hoy account. This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Hoy.
			<br />
			<br />
			(c.) User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
			<br />
			<br />
			(d.) Communications between you and Hoy such as Service-related emails (e.g., application updates, profile verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
			<br />
			<br />
			Log File Information:
			<br />
			<br />
			(a.) Log file information may be submitted by your browser every time you access and visit a web page or app. The same details may still be collected when the content of the web page or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
			<br />
			<br />
			(b.) Upon use of Hoy Service, servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. Hoy may also collect similar information from emails sent to Hoy Users which then assist in tracking which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The collected data will then be used for accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
			<br />
			<br />
			Device Identifiers:
			<br />
			<br />
			(a.) Hoy may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers " once you log in through mobile devices like a tablet or phone. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored together with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Hoy.
			<br />
			<br />
			(b.) Browsing habits and Service use may be reported through a device identifier to Hoy or to a third party partner to help provide reports or personalized content and ads. Certain Service features may depend on availability and functionality of device identifiers.
			<br />
			<br />
			Metadata:
			<br />
			<br />
			(a.) Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when, and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
			<br />
			<br />
			(b.) Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />

			This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is an agreement between you (the "User") and Hoy Technology Asia Corp. ("HTAC", "we", or "us"). We provide Users with a social media platform for advertising with access to certain Materials (as defined below) to help our users capture memories with their smartphones and the brands that they patronize (collectively, the "Services") directly through a mobile application ("Hoy" or "Hoy!").
			<br />
			<br />
			We took care in making our Terms of Service Agreement as understandable and as clear as possible to our Users. This Agreement explains HTAC’s obligations to you and your obligations to us as a user of our mobile application. This Agreement is the entire Agreement between us. By using Hoy, you are agreeing to comply with these terms, our Privacy Policy, Social Guidelines, updates, and other possible legal notices, conditions, or guidelines mentioned in Hoy. HTAC reserves to right to modify its rules or Terms to ensure fairness to the Users and partner Brands/Merchants. If you have suggestions on how we can serve you better or have questions about the Service, please email us at  support@hoyrewards.com and we’ll be happy to hear from you.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			A. DISAMBIGUATION / DEFINITION OF KEYWORDS AND PHRASES
			<br />
			<br />
			A.1) Hoy (otherwise, the "Service") is an advertising rewards (i.e., adrewards) platform for advertising wherein you upload your self portrait (otherwise,"Selfie") photos and videos that capture moments and memories with the brands that you relate with.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.2) A "Selfie" is a self-portrait photograph, video, or moving image (e.g., gif) taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone. Portraits of you taken by other people may also be considered a Selfie. A Selfie may also be referred to herein as a Memory.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.3) A "Brand” is a product or service provider such as restaurants, clothing retailers, food and/or beverage companies, telecommunications companies and other merchants that sell or provide products and services that we love. Brands sponsor the campaigns and the rewards that Hoy users will receive for successfully participating in the campaign. Brands that distribute fast-moving consumer goods (FCMG) may also place campaigns with Hoy for the distribution of their products. Brand may also be interchangeably referred herein as Merchant and/or Advertiser.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.4) A "Post" is a photo or video that a user uploads when pursuing a reward through supporting a Brand’s product. Posts may be photos or videos of you that are taken by you or by other people.  Posts may be a self-portrait in still photo or video form, that depict the brand(s), product(s), or establishment(s) that the Brand is intending to promote.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.5) "Goals"  are selfie tasks that are set and required by the Brand that pertains to a memory the user must capture. A Goal must require the Users to submit a post.  For example, a brand may specify a Goal Memory wherein the user must take a selfie with the brand’s logo.  Posts must follow the Goals and general rules set in the campaign to be qualified for the Reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.6) A “Like” is a reaction received by the user’s selfie posted on Facebook or through Hoy. Clicking like on a post is an easy way to let your favorite brands and your Hoy network know that you enjoy the Memory even without leaving a comment. A Like may be made visible to the public such that when you like a post, the advertiser, your friends and social network may be notified of your reaction to the post. Only one unique Like per user regardless of platform (Hoy or Facebook) will be captured per post.  For selfies posted on Facebook, not all of the reactions received will be considered a qualified Like. A negative response on your posted memory, such as when your friends choose the Angry reaction, will not be considered a qualified “Like”, and that negative reaction will not be counted toward your total number of likes.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.7) A "Reward" is a product or service awarded to a user from the Brand when the user’s post has successfully followed the campaign Goals. For High-Value Rewards Campaign, the users to be rewarded are those whose entries have garnered the most number of likes from Hoy and Facebook, and those whose entries have been selected by the Brand after the campaign period has ended.  Rewards may be awarded in a first-come-first-served basis depending on the number of Rewards being given by the Brand. The type and number of Rewards are set by the Brand sponsoring the campaign and the distribution of the Reward is subject to conditions as set in our Reward Redemption Policies.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.8)  "User Verification" is the process of either manual or automated verification of the user’s identity. The verification process includes but may not be limited to the following: "Facial Recognition" and "Live User Verification".
			<br />
			<br />
			A.9) "Redemption" is the act of claiming a Reward. A rewarded user will receive a Digital Stub in the Hoy app containing details and instructions on how to get the reward. See Rewards Redemption.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.10) A "Digistub" is in-app digital stub that a User receives when he or she receives a Hoy Reward. The Digital Stub contains details about the Reward, instructions on how to redeem the Reward, and user information. See Rewards Redemption.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.11) A “Campaign” is a selfie marketing campaign that gives the User an opportunity to earn rewards when the User shares photos or videos featuring the Brand.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.12) A “Quick Rewards Campaign” is a type of campaign where the users submit a video entry that contains a branded animated filter provided by the Brand. The video must be seven seconds long and must prominently feature the face of the User for a good portion of the video.  The User must submit a valid video entry to receive the Reward.  The Users’ selfies do not need a single like in order to qualify for the Reward.
			<br />
			<br />
			A.13) A “High-Value Rewards” is a type of Campaign where Users must submit a photo Selfie in during a start and end date (i.e., duration) of the Campaign.  For photo Selfies, the photo must include a caption that tells a story about the photo being submitted. The total number of likes that the Selfies receive will be counted after the duration of the Campaign and only likes from unique users will be counted towards the total number of likes.  Users whose Selfies have garnered the highest number of likes from Hoy and Facebook, and Users whose selfies are selected by the Brand will receive the Rewards. The total number of Users who will receive the Rewards will be equivalent to the number of Rewards set by the Brand.
